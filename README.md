# Godot CHIP-8 Emulator

A CHIP-8 emulator written in Godot.

This is a port to GDScript of a CHIP-8 emulator written originally in Java by [Johan](https://github.com/Johnnei/) based on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5PyurErl12czoLyYD8za68d61T_OZsP2) tutorials.

## Getting Started

To run the project load the `res://CRTViewportDisplay/CRT.scn` scene (run with CRT shaders) or load the `res://chip8.tscn` to run without CRT effects.
